it's my first time using git, it was not that bad after searching and watching tutorials ..
the process of adding file was easy and did not take much time (did not faced any issues at all)
but when i get to the branches here the confussion started 

(first issue)

when i add file in one branch it was added in the other branches , 
so i tried to delete them and add one file in each branch and add commit to each file 
here it worked 

(second)
Merging took much time 
i used push&pull and it worked
