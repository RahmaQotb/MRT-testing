Visual Studio Live Share is a feature that allows you to collaboratively edit and debug code with others in real time within a codespace.
  To create a codespace, you need to go to the repository page on GitHub that you want to work on and click the “Code” button. 
  Then, select “Open with Codespaces” and click the “+” button. 
  This will create a new codespace for that repository and open it in Visual Studio Code in your browser.
  To share your codespace with others, you need to click the “Live Share” button on the bottom left corner of Visual Studio Code
